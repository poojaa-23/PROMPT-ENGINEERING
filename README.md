Generative AI: The main concepts

This chapter provides a summary of the main technical principles around GenAI, including its origins and some historical background. Deep neural networks can usually be adapted to be either discriminative or
generative tasks, which has led to the development of various types of GenAI models, which can support different types of input and output data (modes).

Background and historical origins

This chapter provides a summary of the main technical principles around GenAI, including some historical background. GenAI is currently defined more in a descriptive manner than by precise technical features. The 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines GenAI as "a technology that can create content, including text,images, audio, or video, when prompted by a user" (Lorenz et al. 2023). 
"Prompts" here correspond to textual instructions, usually produced by the human users, optionally combined with some given data. Although not mentioned, it is expected that the generated content is new,
meaningful and human-like.In the recent AI Act, the European Union defines GenAI as a type of foundation model (European Commission, European Parliament 2023). Foundation models correspond to general purpose 
AI models trained on large and diverse datasets in order to be used more easily for many different tasks. GenAI systems are a specific subset of foundation models "specifically intended to generate, with 
varying levels of autonomy, content such as complex text, images, audio or video." This definition emphasizes that new content is generated based on existing large training datasets, raising various issues 
and biases more particularly addressed by the AI Act.From the point of view of general users, one key aspect is that unlike the traditional "supervised" machine learning models, which require a large amount of 
task-specific annotated training data.

Deep learning

In the 2010s, neural networks became the dominant approach in AI with deep learning. Although neural networks are well known since the 1950s (Rosenblatt 1957), these models could only use a very limited number of 
neurons and layers – such as the so-called multilayer perceptron (MLP) –until the 1990s. Deep learning is the result of 30 years of cumulative progress to increase ("deepen") the number of layers of neural networks.
With traditional machine learning techniques, the performance canquickly reach a plateau as the amount of training data increases. Adding more data thus becomes useless after a while. One of the key properties 
of deep learning is that the performance continuously increases with the increase in training data. In other words, the more data we feed to a deep neural network (DNN), the better the deep neural network 
generally performs. The performance of these models becomes conditioned by the capacity of the computers and the amount of data 
used for training. Deep learning can surpass any other machine learning approaches, as long massive data and computing resources are available.

Discriminative versus generative tasks

1. Discriminative tasks involve a decision on the input data, such as classification, identifying names in texts or segmenting an image. Discriminative models are models adapted and trained to 
separate input data into these different classes.
2. Generative tasks involve the creation of new data samples given some input data. Generative models are models adapted and trained to create such new data. They are typically used to translate text,
generate images, summarize text or answer questions.


## 2. Focusing on Generative AI architectures. (like transformers).

How does generative AI work?

Generative AI (GenAI) analyzes vast amounts of data, looking for patterns and relationships, then uses these insights to create fresh, new content that mimics the original dataset. It does this by leveraging machine
learning models, especially unsupervised and semi-supervised algorithms.So, what actually does the heavy lifting behind this capability? Neural networks. These networks, inspired by the human brain, ingest vast
amounts of data through layers of interconnected nodes (neurons),which then process and decipher patterns in it. These insights can then be used to make predictions or decisions. With neural networks, we can 
create diverse content, from graphics and multimedia to text and even music.
There are three popular techniques for implementing Generative AI:
 *Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs)
 *Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
 *Transformers
 
What are Generative Adversarial Networks? (GANs)

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of generative model that has two main components: a generator and a discriminator. The generator tries to produce data while the discriminator evaluates it.
Let’s use the analogy of the Autobots and Decepticons in the Transformers franchise. Think of the Autobots as "Generators," trying to mimic and transform into any vehicle or animal on Earth. On the opposite side, 
the Decepticons play the role of "Discriminators," trying to identify which vehicles and animals are truly Autobots. As they engage, the Autobots fine-tune their outputs, motivated by the discerning eyes 
of the Decepticons. Their continuous struggle improves the generator's ability to create data so convincing that the discriminator can't tell the real from the fake.

What are Variational Autoencoders? (VAEs)

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a generative model used mainly in unsupervised machine learning. They can produce new data that lookslike your input data. The main components of VAEs are the encoder, the 
decoder, and a loss function.Within deep learning, consider VAEs as Cybertron's advanced transformation chambers. First, the encoder acts like a detailed scanner, capturing a Transformer's essence into 
latent variables. Then, the decoder aims to rebuild that form, often creating subtle variations. This reconstruction, governed by a loss function, ensures the result mirrors the original while allowing 
unique differences. Think of it as reconstructing Optimus Prime's truck form but with occasional custom modifications.

How Transformers are different from GANs and VAEs

The Transformer architecture introduced several groundbreaking innovations that set it apart from Generative AI techniques like GANs and VAEs. Transformer models understand the interplay of words in a 
sentence, capturing context. Unlike traditional models that handle sequencesstep by step, Transformers process all partssimultaneously, making them efficient and GPU-friendly.
Imagine the first time you watched Optimus Prime transform from a truck into a formidable Autobot leader. That’s the leap AI made when transitioning from traditional modelsto the Transformer architecture.
Multiple projects like Google’s BERT and OpenAI’s GPT-3 and GPT-4, two of the most powerful generative AI models, are based on the
Transformer architecture. These models can be used to generate human￾like text, help with coding tasks, translate from one language to the next, and even answer questions on almost any topic.

## 3. Generative AI applications.

Video Applications

1. Video Generation
OpenAI’s Sora attracted significant attention with its impressive video generation capabilities.2
2. Video Prediction
A GAN-based video prediction system:
*Comprehends both temporal and spatial elements of a video
*Generates the next sequence based on that knowledge (See the figure below)
*Distinguishes between probable and non-probable sequences
GAN-based video predictions can help detect anomalies 
that are needed in a wide range of sectors, such as
security and surveillance.

Image Applications

3. Image Generation

With generative AI, users can transform text into images and generate realistic images based on a setting,subject, style, or location that they specify. 
Therefore, it is possible to generate the needed visual material quickly and simply.It is also possible to use these visual materials for commercial purposes 
that make AI-generated image creation a useful element in media, design, advertisement, marketing, education, etc. For example, an image generator, 
can help a graphic designer create whatever image they need (See the figure below).

4. Semantic Image-to-Photo Translation

Based on a semantic image or sketch, it is possible to produce a realistic version of an image. Due to its facilitative role in making diagnoses, this application is useful for the healthcare sector.

Audio Applications

5. Text-to-Speech Generator

GANs allow the production of realistic speech audios. To achieve realistic outcomes, the discriminators serve as a trainer who accentuates, tones, and/or modulates the voice.
Using this technology, thousands of books have been converted to audiobooks.

6. Music Generation

Generative AI is also purposeful in music production. Music-generation tools can be used to generate novel musical materials for advertisements or other creative purposes.
In this context, however, there remains an important obstacle to overcome, namely copyright infringement caused by the inclusion of copyrighted artwork in training data.

Code-based Applications

7. Code generation

Another application of generative AI is in software development owing to its capacity to produce code without the need for manual coding. Developing code is possible through this quality not only for
professionals but also for non-technical people.

Other Applications

8. Conversational AI

Another use case of generative AI involves generating responses to user input in the form of natural language. This type is commonly used in chatbotsand virtual assistants, which are designed to provide
information, answer questions, or perform tasks for users through conversational interfaces such as chat windows or voice assistants.

In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a game-changing force, revolutionizing the way we interact with technology and transforming countless 
industries. These powerful models can perform a vast array of tasks, from text generation and translation to question-answering and summarization.However, unlocking the full potential of these LLMs requires a deep 
understanding of how to effectively scale these LLMs, ensuring optimal performance and capabilities. In this blog post, we will delve into the crucial concept of scaling techniques for LLM models and explore why 
mastering this aspect is essential for anyone working in the AI domain.Asthe complexity and size of LLMs continue to grow, the importance of scaling cannot be overstated. 
It plays a pivotal role in improving a model’s performance, generalization, and capacity to learn from massive datasets. By scaling LLMs effectively, researchers and practitioners can unlock
unprecedented levels of AI capabilities, paving the way for innovative applications and groundbreaking solutions.

What are Foundational LLM Models?

As the complexity and size of LLMs continue to grow, the importance of scaling cannot be overstated. It plays a pivotal role in improving a model’s performance, generalization, and capacity to learn from 
massive datasets. By scaling LLMs effectively, researchers and practitioners can unlock unprecedented levels of AI capabilities, paving the way for innovative applications and groundbreaking solutions.
Foundation Large Language Models (LLMs) are a class of pre-trained machine learning models designed to understand and generate human￾like text based on the context provided. They are often built using deep
learning techniques, such as the Transformer architecture, and trained on massive amounts of diverse text data. Examples of foundation LLMs include OpenAI’s GPT-3, Google’s BERT, and Facebook’s RoBERTa, etc. 
These LLMs are called “foundational” because they serve as a base for building and fine-tuning more specialized models for a wide range of tasks and applications. Foundation LLMs learn general language
understanding and representation from vast amounts of data, which enables them to acquire a broad knowledge of various domains, topics, and relationships. This general understanding allows them to perform
reasonably well on many tasks “out-of-the-box” without additional training.These foundational LLMs, owing to them being pre-trained, can be fine￾tuned on smaller, task-specific datasets to achieve even better
performance on specific tasks,such as text classification,sentiment analysis, question-answering, translation, and summarization. By providing a robust starting point for building more specialized AI models, 
foundation LLMs greatly reduce the amount of data, time, and computational resources required for training and deploying AI solutions, making them a cornerstone for many applications in natural language 
processing and beyond.

Scaling Techniques for Foundational LLMs

In the context of Large Language Models (LLMs),scaling techniques primarily involve increasing the model size, expanding the training data, and utilizing more compute resources to improve their performance and 
capabilities. The following are the details for some of these techniques along with some of the associated challenges.

Model size:

Scaling the model size typically involves increasing the number of layers and parameters in the transformer neural network architecture. Larger language models have a higher capacity to learn and 
represent complex patterns in the data. However, increasing the model size comes with challenges such as longer training times, higher computational costs, and the possibility of overfitting, especially when
training data is limited. Additionally, larger models may require specialized hardware and optimizations to manage memory and computational constraints effectively.

Training data volume:

Expanding the training data means using more diverse and larger text corpora to train the LLMs. More data helps mitigate the risk of overfitting and enable the models to better generalize and 
understand various domains, topics, and language nuances. However, acquiring and processing large volumes of high￾quality training data can be challenging. Data collection, cleaning, and 
labeling (when required) can be time-consuming and expensive.Moreover, ensuring data diversity and addressing biases present in the data are essential to prevent models from perpetuating harmful
stereotypes or producing unintended consequences.

Compute resources:

Scaling compute resources involves using more powerful hardware (such as GPUs or TPUs) and parallelizing the training process across multiple devices or clusters. This enables LLMs to be
trained faster and more efficiently, allowing researchersto experiment with different model architectures and hyperparameters. However,increasing compute resources comes with higher energy consumption, 
financial costs, and environmental concerns. Additionally, access to such resources may be limited for smaller organizations or individual researchers, potentially widening the gap between well-funded 
institutions and others in the AI research community.

Distributed training:

Employing distributed training techniques allows LLMs to be trained across multiple devices or clusters, making it possible to handle larger models and datasets efficiently. This approach can significantly 
reduce training time and enable better exploration of model architectures and hyperparameters. However, distributed training comes with its own set of challenges, such as increased communication 
overhead, synchronization issues, and the need for efficient algorithms to handle data and model parallelism. Moreover, implementing distributed training requires expertise in both machine learning and 
distributed systems, which can be a barrier for smaller teams or individual researchers.
